The music of this game must encapsulate the feeling of the game perfectly.

Passive refraction endermix

AN endermix is a long, drawn out song that takes an entire album and converts it to one song, creating an entirely new song that uses elements of each of the songs within the album as a refrence. It may stack, morph and transmogrify as the album comes and goes into scope. Find sounds and melodies you like and form a way to create a song that sounds like heaven

Passive refraction and 2814, a spectremix

A spectremix is a song that takes a theme and tone of a song or album and applies that same feel to an endermix to create a brand new and interesting song.

Environmentals

When you walk around, the world should be music to your ears. Music should generate based on what you are experiencing around you
my game will have everything make sounds, and part of the experience is the way you listen. trees, water, and especially esoteric crystals

A fleeting idea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFBOtWq7dsE

"What do you feel when you listen to music? Do you feel what it tries to tell you? Do you see what it tries to show you?"
"All music should evoke a light within you. Sometimes it burns as bright as the morning sky, and sometimes like an incandescent light. Other times it may show as more than a light, and become something entirely different."
"If you are true to the world and yourself, youll feel something when you hear this music."
