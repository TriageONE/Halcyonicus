The music of this game must encapsulate the feeling of the game perfectly.

Passive refraction endermix

AN endermix is a long, drawn out song that takes an entire album and converts it to one song, creating an entirely new song that uses elements of each of the songs within the album as a refrence. It may stack, morph and transmogrify as the album comes and goes into scope. Find sounds and melodies you like and form a way to create a song that sounds like heaven
